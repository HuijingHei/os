# This script is used to update the /etc/passwd file within the COSA container
# at test-time. The need for this comes from the fact that OpenShift will run a
# container with a randomized user ID by default to enhance security. Because
# COSA runs with an unprivileged user ("builder") instead of (container) root,
# this presents special challenges for file and disk permissions. This particular
# pattern was inspired by:
# - https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/jupyter-on-openshift-part-6-running-as-an-assigned-user-id
# - https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/a-guide-to-openshift-and-uids
